# Instructions
A PDF with instructions is provided. 

# Structure
This project is split into several directories. 

### Parts
The parts directory contains all parts you need to produce the actual face shield. Each part has it's own subdirectory. 
Each part directory contains the DXF files and instructions to produce a part. This should be enough to create it. However, we also provide the original designs from which the DXF files were created. 

# Tools
The designs for tools we used are also provided. Note: These tools were designed specifically for our machine and use-case. Though we think the ideas and some of the desings may be usefull, some modifications will likely be needed.
